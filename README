ESOP 07 Termination Analysis Tool 
--------------------------------------------

Source of the tool is in termination-tool. The analysis is based on CIL. 
This version has been cleaned up and now works with CIL 1.40 and OCaml 3.12. 

The tool requires Rankfinder and Simplify:

Rankfinder: http://www7.in.tum.de/~rybal/rankfinder/

Simplify: http://www.kindsoftware.com/products/opensource/Simplify/

Steps to run the analyser:

1. First change the location of rankfinder and Simplify binaries in termination-tool/config.ml
   Its easier to hardcode the path rather than using relative paths. 
2. Now go into cil directory and run ./configure && make
3. This should build a binary called cil/bin/cilly

4. To run the analysis: 
   cil/bin/cilly --doterminationanalysis file1.c
